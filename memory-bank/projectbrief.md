# Project Brief: Stripe Next.js Subscription Demo

## Core Requirements

Build a complete Stripe subscription integration with Next.js that demonstrates:

1. **Embedded Payment Forms**: Use Stripe's PaymentElement for seamless checkout experience
2. **Subscription Management**: Handle recurring billing with proper status tracking
3. **Webhook Integration**: Process Stripe events for real-time subscription updates
4. **Database Persistence**: Store customer, subscription, and payment data with type safety
5. **Production Ready**: Include proper error handling, security, and deployment configuration

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Demonstrate modern Stripe integration patterns with Next.js 15
- Showcase embedded checkout flows using React Stripe.js
- Implement comprehensive webhook handling for subscription lifecycle
- Provide type-safe database operations with Prisma ORM
- Create production-ready code with proper security measures

### Success Criteria
- Users can complete subscription checkout flow without redirects
- Webhook events properly update database records
- Application handles all subscription states (active, canceled, past_due, etc.)
- Codebase is maintainable with comprehensive documentation
- Deployment ready with environment configuration

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Stripe subscription checkout with embedded forms
- Customer and subscription data management
- Webhook event processing for subscription lifecycle
- Database schema for Stripe entities
- Basic user interface for payment flow
- Development and production configuration

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Customer portal for subscription management
- Multiple payment methods per customer
- Complex pricing models (usage-based, tiered)
- Admin dashboard for subscription analytics
- Email notifications and customer communication

## Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15 with App Router (latest patterns)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Stripe API version compatibility
- PostgreSQL database requirement
- Vercel deployment target
- Security best practices for payment processing

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional**: Complete payment flow from checkout to webhook processing
2. **Technical**: Type-safe operations, proper error handling, secure webhook verification
3. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation, organized code structure, easy setup process
4. **Performance**: Fast loading times, optimized builds, efficient database queries
