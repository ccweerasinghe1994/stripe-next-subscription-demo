# Product Context: Stripe Subscription Integration

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Developers often struggle to implement Stripe subscriptions correctly, especially with modern Next.js patterns. Common pain points include:

- Complex integration between Stripe's client/server components
- Proper webhook handling for subscription state management
- Type-safe database operations for payment data
- Security considerations for payment processing
- Modern React patterns with Stripe.js

### Solution Approach
This project provides a complete, production-ready reference implementation that:

- Uses the latest Stripe embedded checkout patterns
- Demonstrates proper Next.js 15 App Router integration
- Shows comprehensive webhook event handling
- Implements type-safe database operations with Prisma
- Follows security best practices for payment processing

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Landing Page**: User sees subscription offering with clear pricing
2. **Checkout Initiation**: Click triggers embedded Stripe checkout form
3. **Payment Processing**: User completes payment without page redirects
4. **Confirmation**: Success page shows subscription details
5. **Background Processing**: Webhooks update database with subscription data

### Technical Flow

1. **Client Side**: React components load Stripe Elements
2. **Server Actions**: Next.js server actions create checkout sessions
3. **Payment Processing**: Stripe handles secure payment collection
4. **Webhook Events**: Stripe sends events to `/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. **Database Updates**: Webhook handler updates Prisma database
6. **State Synchronization**: Application reflects current subscription status

## Target Outcomes

### For Users
- Seamless checkout experience without redirects
- Clear subscription status and payment confirmation
- Secure payment processing with Stripe's infrastructure

### For Developers
